# Car-Accident-Analysis

The impact of traffic accidents in the United States cost citizens hundreds of billions of dollars every year and the number of car accidents has dramatically increased in the last 5 years. Reducing traffic accidents is an important challenge. I will identify the patterns of how these accidents happen and the key factors.  

# Data Source:

This is a countrywide car accident dataset, which covers 48 states of the USA. The accident data are collected from February 2016 to Dec 2020, using multiple APIs that provide streaming traffic incident (or event) data. These APIs broadcast traffic data captured by a variety of entities, such as the US and state departments of transportation, law enforcement agencies, traffic cameras, and traffic sensors within the road-networks. Currently, there are about 1.5 million accident records in this dataset. Check here to learn more about this dataset. 
 

Version 5 (Dec 2020): In this version,  data is collected from February 2016 to Dec 2020 for the Contiguous United States. In this dataset, we have about 1.5 million traffic accidents. Download data from here.
